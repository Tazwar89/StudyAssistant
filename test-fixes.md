# Study Assistant - Test Guide & Fixes

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: Firebase Rules Update Required**

**Before testing, you MUST update your Firebase Firestore rules:**

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: `hackthe6ix-ab103`
3. Navigate to: **Firestore Database** → **Rules**
4. Replace the current rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

5. Click **"Publish"** and wait 30-60 seconds for deployment

## 🤖 **NEW: Google Gemini API Setup (Optional but Recommended)**

**To enable intelligent AI chatbot responses:**

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in and create a free API key
3. Create a `.env` file in your project root:
   ```bash
   VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
   ```
4. Restart the development server
5. See `gemini-setup-guide.md` for detailed instructions
